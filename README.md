## üöÄ About This Project

**Aroma Coffee Co.** is a premium landing page concept for a modern coffee shop. This project is more than just a static information page; it's a **cinematic and immersive digital experience**. The goal is to evoke the warm, high-quality atmosphere of a coffee shop through elegant design, fluid interactions, and purposeful animations.

This project serves as a high-quality portfolio piece showcasing the ability to build modern web interfaces that are not only functional but also deliver a memorable "wow factor" and an unforgettable user experience.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Cinematic Scroll Experience:** The page tells a story as the user scrolls, starting with a magnificent Hero Section and transitioning gracefully through the brand's story and artistic gallery.
* **Premium Smooth Scrolling:** Integrates **Lenis** to create a luxurious, fluid scrolling experience, eliminating jerky default browser behavior.
* **Scroll-Triggered Animations (Framer Motion):** Key elements are animated using Framer Motion's `useScroll` and `useTransform` hooks. Effects like slow-zoom on the hero image and parallax create an illusion of depth and dynamic movement.
* **Interactive Menu with Slider:** The menu section utilizes **Swiper.js** to create a responsive, touch-friendly category slider with smooth transitions between menu galleries.
* **Artistic Photo Gallery:** Features a dynamic **Masonry-style** photo gallery with an interactive lightbox, turning a standard gallery into a digital exhibition.
